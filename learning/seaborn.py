#Seaborn is a python data viz library, developed to easily create common chart types; works well with pandas data structures and built on top of matplotlib

#getting started with scatterplot
#import seaborn as sns
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#sns.scatterplot(x=xlistname, y=ylistname)
#plt.show()

#count plots take in a categorical list & return bars that represent the number of list entries per category
#sns.countplot(x=listname)

#working with pandas DataFrames
#import pandas as pd
#df = pd.read_csv("name.csv")
#df.head() 

#using DataFrames with countplot()
#import pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
#create a pandas DataFrame from csv file to create the countplot instead of a list of data
#
